A few days after starting at Square, I attended an *Email Efficiency* session, given by [Xavier Shay](http://xaviershay.com/).

> Learn practical techniques to manage your inbox. The outcome will reduce stress, increase efficiency, and increase effectiveness. Bring your computer and leave with an empty inbox!

I was skeptical at first. I had tried different techniques, each time after reading a new book or article.

I had an *almost empty* inbox, where I kept everything that was *waiting for something*: either an action from me or an answer from someone.

I never achieved a real zero inbox. **Until now**. And it feels good. Really.

## <a id="Principle" href="#Principle">Principle</a>

The core idea is simple: never leave an email in your inbox. The inbox is good at triage, and that's all.

You must go through all the emails in your inbox, and for each email, apply this simple workflow:

1. Do you need to do something about this email?
    * If you can do it in less then a minute, **do it now**.
    * Otherwise, put it on a **todo list**.
2. **Archive** the email
3. Go to the **next email**

> Don't waste your time putting labels on emails. Gmail search function is powerful enough.

Combine that workflow with keyboard shortcuts, and you'll reach *empty inbox* really fast!

Then, once your inbox is empty, you can start doing the stuff that's on your todo list.

## <a id="TODO Lists" href="#TODO Lists">TODO Lists</a>

There are a lot of Todo list tools out there. My everyday todo list is called *white sheet of paper*. For longer term todos, I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/).

TODO: Use Google task

To activate keyboard shortcuts in Gmail, go to the settings:

In the **General** tab, toggle `Keyboard shortcuts on` and hit **Save Changes**:

TODO : Use { and }  and shift + T

> Tip: to learn new shortcuts, hit **&lt;Shift&gt;** + *?*

## <a id="Conclusion" href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a>

You may think that this article is nonsense, that I just moved my "pending things" from the inbox to a todo list. Yes, that's right. Still, it makes me feel better. I don't need to recheck my inbox every 5 minutes and scan through the mails to see if 

What if you currently have a thousand emails in your inbox? It's pretty simple too: start fresh 


Word on : not using priority inbox
No need for trash
Filters: mark as read, archive. No labels
