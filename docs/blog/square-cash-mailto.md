This week, Square introduced [Square Cash](http://square.com/cash), a new service that lets you send money to your friends through email.

To use it, just send your friend an email with the **amount** in the **subject** and **Cc** **cash@square.com**.

That's it, you don't need to install any new app, go through a painful signup process, or use a specific email provider.

It's **free**, **simple**, [secure](https://squareup.com/help/en-us/article/5144-square-cash-security).

Here is a trick I'd like to share with you: you can make it even simpler for friends who owe you money by sending them a **mailto** link. Then, they just need to click on the link to open their favorite email app and send that worthy email.


```html
<a href="mailto:your@email.com?subject=$1&amp;cc=cash@square.com">Send me money!</a>
```

[:fontawesome-solid-envelope: Send me money!](mailto:py.ricau+casharticle@gmail.com?subject=$1&amp;cc=cash@square.com){ .md-button }


I think that's a pretty cool way to collect money from your friends :) .

Side note: as of now, Square Cash only works in the US.
