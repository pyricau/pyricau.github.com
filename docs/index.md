# Pierre-Yves Ricau

:wave: Nice to meet you! My friends call me **P-Y** or Pierre. My pronouns are he / him. I work on the [Square](http://squareup.com/) side of [Block](https://block.xyz/), as a **Principal Android Engineer**.


## Life

After 12 years in San Francisco, I just moved to Lyon, France! I enjoy being with my family, [rollerblading, baking](https://instagram.com/py.ricau/) and reading [sci-fi](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1180292158361747456).

## Work


Since 2009 I've mostly been doing **Android** adjacent things. I like to vent on social media then write proper technical articles at [blog.p-y.wtf](https://blog.p-y.wtf). I've worked at Square since 2013. Over the years I have published a number of open source [libraries](open_source.md) (including LeakCanary), technical [articles](articles.md) and [presentations](public_speaking.md).

## Reach out!


I have DMs open on social media: [:fontawesome-brands-bluesky:](https://bsky.app/profile/p-y.wtf) [:fontawesome-brands-instagram:](https://instagram.com/py.ricau/).

Don't reach out on LinkedIn. I never open LinkedIn.

My email is py dot [my last name] at gmail dot com (I'm probably not fooling any AI bots with this, but that was worth a try).
