# Pierre-Yves Ricau

:wave: Nice to meet you! My friends call me **P-Y** or Pierre. My pronouns are he / him. I work at [Square](http://squareup.com/) within [Block](https://block.xyz/), in San Francisco, as an **Android Distinguished Engineer**.


## Life


I live in San Francisco, I enjoy being with my family, [rollerblading, baking](https://www.instagram.com/py.ricau/) and reading [sci-fi](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1180292158361747456).

## Work

Since 2009 I've mostly been doing **Android** adjacent things, at Square for the last decade. I have published a number of open source [libraries](open_source.md) (including LeakCanary), technical [articles](articles.md) and [presentations](public_speaking.md).

## Reach out!


I usually read any DM that isn't recruiting or spam on [Mastodon](https://androiddev.social/@py) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Piwai). I never open LinkedIn. If you really want my attention, get someone I trust to connect us.
