# Pierre-Yves Ricau

:wave: Nice to meet you! My friends call me **P-Y** or Pierre. My pronouns are he / him. I work at [Square](http://squareup.com/) within [Block](https://block.xyz/), in San Francisco, as an **Android Distinguished Engineer**.

## Life

I live in San Francisco, I enjoy being with my family, [rollerblading, baking](https://www.instagram.com/py.ricau/) and reading [sci-fi](https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1180292158361747456).

## Work

Since 2009 I've mostly been doing **Android** adjacent things, at Square for the last decade. I have published a few noticeable open source [libraries](open_source.md), technical [articles](articles.md) and [presentations](public_speaking.md).
